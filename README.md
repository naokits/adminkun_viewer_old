About Mr.Admin quote from @IT
Deep inside the labyrinth of modern Tokyo, nestled somewhere in the sprawl of neon, instant noodles, and kimono-clad denizens, in a building that knows no fire code standards, toiling away around the clock stands one man: the system administrator. Waging a never-ending battle, the "Sys Admin" strikes terror into the hearts of computer viruses, makes short work of scheduled data back-ups, and understands complex technologies so that his superiors won't have to.

"Mr. Admin" is the English version of Japan's "Ganbare! Admin-kun" weekly four-panel web comic. Stories usually revolve around the IT staff at an unnamed company in a shabby building somewhere in Tokyo. Though most of the recurring characters have proper names, the persevering main character is known only as "Mr. Admin." This is a glimpse into the world of IT workers in Japan. Enjoy!
